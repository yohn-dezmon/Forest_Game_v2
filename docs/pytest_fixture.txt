Fixtures don’t work like this. They cannot magically transfer the name a from one
function’s (setup) local scope to another’s (test). Instead, your setup function
must explicitly return the object that will be passed as the setup argument to
your test function.

@pytest.mark.parametrize to run a test with a different set of input and expected values. This addresses the same need to keep your code slim avoiding duplication.
